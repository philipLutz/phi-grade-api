# &Phi; Phi Grade

In response to certain professional athletes creating an elitist and exclusive system for rock climbing grades with hopes of making their social media more exciting, Phi Grade intentionally introduces an encrypted and unneccessarily complicated way to grade rock climbs.  All rock climbing grading systems are a subjective attempt to quantify the difficulty for a human to climb a rock, and believeing that one can truthfully and consistently create such a system is na√Øve.
